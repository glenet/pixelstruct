[PixelStruct](http://da.vidr.cc/projects/pixelstruct/) is an opensource tool for visualizing 3D scenes reconstructed from photographs. It uses the opensource structure-from-motion system [Bundler](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/), which is based on the same research as [Microsoft Live Labs Photosynth](http://livelabs.com/photosynth/).

See the [project homepage](http://da.vidr.cc/projects/pixelstruct/) for further information.
